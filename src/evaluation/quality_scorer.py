"""
Computes Precision, Recall, and F1 for each strategy by comparing LLM
verdicts against the gold standard.

Macro averaging treats each compliance dimension equally regardless of
class imbalance. Recall carries more weight in the discussion: in
compliance work, missing a real flag is more serious than raising a
false alarm.
